# Pimoroni PGA Boilerplate

This repository is intended to provide a baseline MicroPython build for PGA2040
and PGA2350, in addition to being a minimal example of how you might set up your
own custom MicroPython flavour to support your PGA-based project.

Use this repository as a boilerplate to set up your own project, and GitHub actions
should automatically handle building MicroPython for you.
