# Examples

# balls_demo.py

Our timeless silly bouncing balls demo, shows off drawing in PicoGraphics.

# button_test.py

Want to test your buttons? Look no further!

# clock.py

We'd be remiss without an example to flex our new PicoVector and PicoGraphics improvements. If you're not using your Explorer for anything else, then here's a handy Analog or Digital desk clock for you. Connect to your computer and use Thonny to automagically set the time.

# cubes.py

Seen those spinny wire mesh cube demos and wondered "how do they do that?" well you can continue to wonder, because this code makes me cry.

# display_jpg.py

As the name suggests, this example will display a JPEG. Remember, it's "f" as in "Photographic" so technically you should pronounce it "jfeg.""

# display_png.py

Bored of jfegs? Display a PNG instead... no, not the sound, but an image. PNG's are great because they can be *paletted* and give you super crisp details for low colour applications. Think icons, icons and, uh, icons!

# double_tap.py / double_tap_async.py

A delightful example for the LSM6DS3 accelerometer on our [multi sensor stick](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/multi-sensor-stick). Knock on your desk, go on!

The async version uses `asyncio.create_task` to poll for a tap event. Keeps your main loop all nice and clean.

# explorer_sensor_stick_demo.py

Another example for our [multi sensor stick](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/multi-sensor-stick). Uh, sorry. I guess this is a bit of an upsell. But it's three pretty cool sensors in one... and not a bag of virtual gems!

Displays light, acceleromater and temperature data!

# external_buttons.py

Gotta put something on that little breadboard, right! How about more buttons. You can never have enough buttons. The ones they keep taking out of cars must go somewhere!?

# image_gallery.py

At a loss for what to do with your Explorer. Clock just not your cup of tea? How about a digital photo frame! Those are still cool, right?

# marker.py

If you haven't Google'd "permenant marker font" yet, you really should. It's about the only worthwhile thing Google.com still does.

# maze.py

It's a-maze-ing! Use the C, Z, A and B buttons to navigate.

# multiple_servos.py

You can't do much with one servo, so how about multiple? You could be well on your way to being the next terrifyingly lifelike robot engineer!

# potentiometer.py

While it sounds like something for detecting ghosts or 1920s Soviet silent movies, a potentiometer is actually just a resistor, in a circle, with a knob to change its resistance. This one weird trick gives you a rotary control for your projects... use it to wiggle a servo!

# rainbow.py

Cue [appropriate musical accompaniment](https://remix.kwed.org/files/RKOfiles/Lagerfeldt%20-%20Flip%20the%20Flop%20(Rock%20My%20Commodore).mp3) before launching.

# shake.py

Another example for our [multi sensor stick](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/multi-sensor-stick). A truly classic falling sand demo. [Shake it off. Shake it off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRMHp7_kPec)

# simple_menu.py

How to menu? How to menu!

# single_servo.py

Nobody wants one servo... though I guess this does demonstrate all the cool features Chris packed into our servo library. Give it a go!

# step_counter.py

Another example for our [multi sensor stick](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/multi-sensor-stick). Turns out the LSM6DS3 has turnkey step counting built right in... I guess we know how all those sports trackers work now!

# tone_song.py

By the grace of alphabetical ordering this wonderful musical example has come last. I think parents will thank us for this.
